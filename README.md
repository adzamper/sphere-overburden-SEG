# Sphere-overburden program

Code used to calculate the airborne EM response of a sphere underlying conductive overburden, The solution is calculated using the semi-analytic solution set presented in Desmerais & Smith (2016).

For more on the sphere-overburden solution see:

Here you will find the following: 
  - A compressed executable file of the sphere overburden program (unzip and run) 
  - The code base used to create the executable 
  - A python jupyter notebook with brief description and demonstration of program capabilities (open in browser)
